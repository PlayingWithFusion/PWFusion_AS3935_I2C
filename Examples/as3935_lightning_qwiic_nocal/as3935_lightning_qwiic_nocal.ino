* File Name: as3935_lightning_i2c_nocal.ino
* Processor/Platform: Arduino Uno R3 (tested), R3aktor M0 Logger (tested)
* Development Environment: Arduino 1.6.1
*
* Designed for use with with Playing With Fusion AS3935 Lightning Sensor
* Breakout: SEN-39001-R01. Demo shows how this lightning sensor can be brought 
* into an Arduino project without a bunch of calibration needed. This is
* because each board is tested calibrated prior to being shipped, and the 
* cal value is written on the packaging.
*
*   SEN-39001-R01 (universal applications)

* APPLICATION SPECIFIC NOTES (READ THIS!!!):
* - This file configures then runs a program on an Arduino to interface with
*   an AS3935 Franklin Lightning Sensor manufactured by AMS.
*    - Configure Arduino
*    - Perform setup for AS3935 chip
*      --- capacitance registers for tuning (based on cal value provided)
*      --- configurations for your application specifics (indoor/outdoor, etc)
*    - read status/info from sensor
*    - Write formatted information to serial port
* - Set configs for your specific needs using the #defines for wiring, and
*   review the setup() function for other settings (indoor/outdoor, for example)
* 
* Circuit:
*    R3aktor  -->  SEN-39001: AS3935 Breakout
*    Qwiic         Qwiic
